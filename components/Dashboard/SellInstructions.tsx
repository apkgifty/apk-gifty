          Before sending us your gift card, we kindly request you to ensure that
          you have confirmed or verified its balance.

        <li>

          For cards like Onevanilla, refrain from checking the balance on
          balance.VanillaGift.com, as it may cause harm to the card and render
          it invalid. Instead, contact the Onevanilla call center to verify if
          the card is active with the correct balance before sending it to us.

          For cards from retailers like Walmart, BestBuy, and others, you can

          Once you have confirmed the balance, you can proceed to send us your
          gift card. Typically, we aim to process payments within 30 minutes to
          1 hour after verification and usage of your gift card. However, please
          note that the timeframe may vary if there is a high volume of Sell
          Orders on our platform.

          If your card's balance is valid for usage, you can rest assured that
          everything will proceed smoothly. Your card will be utilized, and
          payment will be made to your account as expected.
        </li>

        Upon verifying the card's balance and completing the payment, our
        administration will automatically close the trade.
