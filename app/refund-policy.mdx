**Conditions for Returns**

In order for the Goods to be eligible for a return, please make sure that:

- if you make payment to our system and we suddenly became out of stock for said gift card refund will be made to the user account.

The following Goods cannot be returned:

- The supply of Goods made to Your specifications or clearly personalized.
- The supply of Goods which according to their nature are not suitable to be returned, or shall have near expiry.
- The supply of Goods which are, after delivery, according to their nature, inseparably mixed with other items
- Once a gift card has been issued a **User** has a 30mins time frame to use the gift card provided. Before a gift card will be issued to a buyer the balance and everything would have been confirmed already. Hence it is more important to make sure you're ready to use a gift card once you make payment for an order. Failure to use the card within the timeframe and extending that timeframes comes at a risk where refund may not be possible once card has been provided with balance intact.
- Make sure the gift card you're purchasing matches your account region. Most gift cards we will provide region are mostly USA.

We reserve the right to refuse returns of any goods/services that does not meet the above return conditions in our sole discretion.

Only regular priced Goods may be refunded. Unfortunately, Goods on sale/promotion cannot be refunded/exchanged. This exclusion may not apply to You if it is not permitted by applicable law.
